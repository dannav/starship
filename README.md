Starship is a full text search engine and indexer for any kind of text document (pdf/word/txt/rtf/etc...). I pursued this project last year (EOY 2018 - JAN 2019) as
a small experiment while researching ways to index documents.

The documentation may be old and outdated as I haven't touched it in a little more than a year as I've decided to focus on more
important projects.

Given the current macro state I decided to open source this code as I think some teams that are now required to work remotely
might benefit from this.

Even if you have no need for this project it might help anyone interested in learning how to structure large projects in go.

Enjoy ðŸ¥³

p.s. You can view the documentation by running `npm run dev` in the `./docs` folder. A documentation website will be spun up.
