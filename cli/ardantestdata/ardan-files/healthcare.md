After 90 days as an employee with Ardan Labs you will be eligible to enroll into
our group healthcare insurance plan.

There is a more basic plan and an upgraded one. Ardan Labs covers 50% of the basic plan.
Should you choise the upgraded plan Ardan Labs will cover the same amount of money
but will turn out to be less than 50% of the plan. See the prices spreadsheet below to
get an estimate. To get your card register on www.aetna.com.

Dental and Vision is also available. Instructions for getting your card from the Humana website
are below.

To register for insurance, fill out the Aetna application below and email it to John specifying what health plan you want and if you want dental and/or vision.

Once enrolled in the health plan $25,000 in life insurance is automatically included and
paid for by Ardan Labs.
