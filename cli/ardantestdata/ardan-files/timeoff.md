Request timeoff through PurelyHR's calendar https://ardan.purelyhr.com/cpanel/calendar. If you are a contractor
always choose `Contractor` for timeoff type. For employees choose `Vacation` for timeoff and `Out of Office` if planning
to leave during the day.

John or Ed will be notified and approve the request. Below is our typical policy.

## Employees

* One week of paid time off during the first year.
* Two weeks of paid time off during the second year.
* After six months the last week of December the office will be closed and is additional paid time off.
* All time off must be submitted via email and approved by a manager.
