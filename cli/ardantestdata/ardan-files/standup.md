Regardless of the client or project you are working on you should join the
Ardan Labs stand up. It is through Google hangout
[[https://hangouts.google.com/hangouts/_/ardanlabs.com/standup]]
at 10AM ET.

Basic stand up. Mention what you did yesterday, what you plan to do today and
raise any major issues\blockers. It typically takes around 10 minutes.

We go in order of seniority with Ardan Labs. See below.
