# Starship CLI

The Starship CLI requires an existing Starship instance to connect to for use. If you're interested in
setting up your own instance of Starship visit the section on [running Starship](/getting-started/running-starship)
in our documentation.

# Usage

To install the latest version of the Starship CLI and you have go installed, run this command:

```

go get -u github.com/starship-fyi/starship-cli

```

Otherwise, visit the releases page for binaries compiled for your operating system.
