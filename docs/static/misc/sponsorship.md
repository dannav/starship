## Sponsoring Starship

Starship is free open source software, and building high quality software takes
a ton of time and resources. Sponsorship helps to continue moving the project forward
and is greatly appreciated. If you've gotten any value out of Starship or would
like to support its future development, please consider sponsoring!

To sponsor Starship contact Danny Navarro at [navdgo@gmail.com](mailto:navdgo@gmail.com).
