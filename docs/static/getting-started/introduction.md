Starship was born from the frustrations of working in a remote first company. When documents are spread
out across teams and projects, having a central location that you can query for information empowers
people to be autonomous in their work.

## Aspirations

The goal of Starship is to create a unified search experience for any kind of information, wherever
you store it. Integrations are planned for all the major storage providers like Dropbox, Google Drive, and
Office 365.
