Starship is a Document Search API that provides the opportunity to create you or your company's own private
search engine for internal information. It currently supports indexing any type of text based document, and uses
machine intelligence to provide a modern search experience.

## Inspiration

Starship was born from the frustrations of working in a remote first company. When documents are spread
out across teams and projects, having a central location that you can query for information empowers
people to be autonomous in their work.

## Aspirations

The goal of Starship is to create a unified search experience for any kind of information, wherever
you store it. Integrations are planned for all the major storage providers like Dropbox, Google Drive, and
Office 365.
