## Installation

It is strongly recommended that you use a released version of the Starship CLI. While master is never purposefully broken, its stability is not guaranteed.

## Binary Installation

Pre-compiled binaries are available on the releases page of the [Starship CLI](http://google.com) repository.

## Using Go

If you already have [go](https://golang.org) installed, you can install the StarshipCLI using `go get`.

```go
go get -u github.com/starship-fyi/starship-cli
```
